Choosing a game name stopped being fun 500 iterations ago. The original name "Golden Cannon" did
not feel right for how the game has turned out. Here is my criteria for success:

- Memorable and short
- Availability: App store, domain availability, avoids trademark violations
- The mood: Mysterious 
- The location: Ocean and Ships
- The genre: Puzzles
- The core mechanic: Tilting 

The first 2 points seem to conflict for most ideas. With over a million apps in the iOS store alone, 
many memorable and short app names are taken. Here are a few amassed with the help of my brother Keir.

- Abraxis
- Ebb
- Iron seas
- Eon
- Kraken
- Nero
- Slant
- Angular
- Arcamedes
- Mystery Ship
- The Rolling Curse
- Octavius
- Angulus
- Manchuria
- The Manchurian Curse
- Cassandra
- Tilt Deck
- Saxon
- Britanic 
- Lost
- Baychimo
- Pequod 
- Pequad
- Titan
- Madrigal 
- Juniper
- Europa
- Celeste
- Aurora
- Arabella
- Arcadia
- Nautilus
- Dragon fish
- Rickets 
- Battery
- Gun crew
- etc etc etc
