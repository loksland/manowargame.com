A new mechanic is introduced in each stage as outlined below:

**Stage Abraxas** - the first stage - is pretty basic with black cannons and balls only.

{% include post-img.html img="stage-art-B17.jpg" img_preset="post_med" alt="Stage B" %}
**Stage Blepsei** introduces colour. Coloured cannons only affect their corresponding 
colour balls and rotating platforms.

{% include post-img.html img="stage-art-G7.jpg" img_preset="post_med" alt="Stage C" %}
**Stage Gnosis** - the final stage - features booths that swap the colour of any balls 
that roll through them.
