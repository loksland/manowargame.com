After over a year in development, I'm happy to announce that Manowar is finally available in the [App Store.](http://itunes.apple.com/app/id965680122)

Taking an independant game from planning stage to finished product was at times very challenging. 
The sheer volume of work involved in iterating the design and polishing was relentless and daunting. 

I am immensely thankful to have had received amazing support and advice from family and friends who in the end got this project over the line. 

I am proud of the result and hope that the game finds an audience of some kind who enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed making it.

The process is by no means finished either. Look out for improvements and updates in the months ahead.

thanks!  
Lachlan
