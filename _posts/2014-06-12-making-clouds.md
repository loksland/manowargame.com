I love the clouds from the film poster for Hayao Miyazaki's 'The Wind Rises' and wanted
something similar for Manowar.

This seems to be done in gouache or similar opaque paint where the artist was able to 
'paint on' the white hilights. As I'm using watercolour this was not an
option, so I decided to work in reverse.

{% include post-img.html img="miyazaki-cloud-2.png" img_preset="post_small" %}
First the source image was cleaned up and inverted.
{% include post-img.html img="cloud-attempt-2-scan.png" img_preset="post_full" %}
Using the above as a reference I painted a watercolour in blue.
{% include post-img.html img="cloud-attempt-2-invert.png" img_preset="post_full" %}
Then the result was scanned and colours inverted, which greatly increases the realism of the 
result. 
{% include post-img.html img="cloud-results.png" img_preset="post_med" %}
The result applied to the game.
