I'm very pleased to learn that Manowar has won a Puzzle App Game of the Year (PAYG) award, in the Best Physics Puzzle category. 
The awards are curated by puzzle authority Tom Cutrofello ([@labmicepuzzles](https://twitter.com/labmicepuzzles)) who runs the superb Gotta Solve It
puzzle blog. 

Tom's reviews are always honest, to the point and thoroughly considered. I've always held his blog to be the premiere puzzle app review site on the web, so this means a lot to me. 

Check out all the amazing winners here:
