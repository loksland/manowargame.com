This is the initial playable demo of the game (requires <a href="http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer" target="_blank" >Flash</a>).

- The aim is to fire all the balls off the ship to complete the level.
- **Drag** the ship left <-> right to roll the balls into the cannons. 
- **Tap** anywhere to fire.

This prototype was made to work out if the core mechanic of the game is compelling 
enough to continue. 
It has been well accepted through play testing and there seems to be some potential for 
this concept to grow to support some really interesting puzzle ideas.

It didn't - but I will proceed with the project nonetheless.
