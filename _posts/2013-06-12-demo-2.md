This is the second prototype of the game (requires <a href="http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer" target="_blank" >Flash</a>).

- The aim is to fire all the balls off the ship to complete the level.
- **Drag** the ship left <-> right to roll the balls into the cannons.
- **Tap** anywhere to fire.

Still trying to work out the core mechanic with variations on the original concept. This
includes internal firing cannons and cannon ball boxes that crack open to release more
balls.
