#### Frequently Asked Questions

Q. **I'm stuck on a level**
{% endmarkdown %}
<ul>
	<li>Balls move in unison, often forcing an undesired outcome. It may be useful to think about how to separate them.</li>
	<li>Some levels require manipulating the balls in unconventional way. Keep experimenting and think outside the box.</li>
	<li>If there is one difficult ball always left at the end it may help to devise the criteria for clearing this one and working back from there.</li>
	<li>As a general rule of thumb the levels usually require logical solution rather than a skill challenge (This is not the case in the bonus stage!)</li>
	<li>Red herrings are very rare. eg. If a cannon or platform exists it is usually part of the solution.</li>

Q. **Where is the bonus stage?**  
The bonus stage is unlocked after completing the game.

Q. **My husband has been offered a job out of state. My whole family is in the Delaware area. What do I do?**  
Tough call. I would recommend talking to him openly about your fears of being isolated in a new city. Tasha is at a good age to move and kids are more resilient to change than you can imagine. Have you thought about updating your hospitality diploma?
