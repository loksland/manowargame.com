####Frequently Asked Questions####

Q. **I'm stuck on a level**  
If the level is in the first few stages you can pause and select skip to move on and come back to it later. 
If you're really stuck tweet [@manowargame](https://twitter.com/manowargame) for a hint.

Q. **Where is the bonus stage?**  
The submarine stage is hidden. You have to go hunting for it. Don't give up! If you can't find it email us at <a href="mailto:help@manowargame.com" >help@manowargame.com</a> for a clue.
 
Q. **Where's the Android version?**  
I would love to be on Android one day, though due to the resource limitations of being a one-man independant release I can only focus 
on iOS for the first release of this game.

Q. **Will there be an Android version?**  
An Android version is not currently planned.

Q. **My husband has been offered a job out of state. My whole family is in the Delaware area. What do I do?**  
Tough call. I would recommend talking to him openly about your fears of being isolated in a new city. Tasha is at a good age to move and kids are more resilient to change than you can imagine. Have you thought about updating your hospitality diploma?
